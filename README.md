Docker container with Python 3.10 set as default version for fellow students who have trboule with Python versioning.

If you are using CodeSpace then Docker is already installed so in the terminal, run the following code to test if it's live:
```
docker run --name cs50ai-container meanmachinerex/cs50ai:1.0
```
If you have a response logged in the console like:
```
Hello, world! Running on Python 3.10
```
Then you are all set! All you need to do is download the zip files, run the requriements.txt files and do your projects.

Thank you for using this docker container!
